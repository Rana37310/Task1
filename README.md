## Abstract Class vs. Interface
### Question:
What is the main difference between an abstract class and an interface in PHP? Provide an example of a scenario where you would prefer to use an abstract class over an interface.

### Answer:
An abstract class is more flexible than an interface. This is because an abstract class allows both concrete and abstract functions, with various encapsulation options, while an interface requires all functions to be abstract and public. 
In the progression example, I used an abstract class to handle both concrete and abstract functions, which allows me to inherit these functions in the `ArithmeticProgression` subclasses.
